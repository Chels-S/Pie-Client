- useState always accepts two values:
    - the state variable that's based upon the intital value we pass into it. (In this case, undefined)
    - A function defined as setSessionToken. setSessionToken is our means of changing the value of our state variable 

    - naming convention for state variables is always what our state variable is called, and then 'set'____

    Naming convention for components is to start with a Capital letter
